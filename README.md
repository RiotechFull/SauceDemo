# Saucedemo QA automation with Cypress

This repository presents the final work of the Testing QA automation training using the Cypress tool.
It is requested that 2 types of users can log in to the website and simulate the process of a purchase.
A test plan and bugs was generated in **Google Drive** to later automate it. Then, in trello, the incidences are reflected to finally generate the automated test in Cypress to execute it. (‚ÄúmyTestSaucedemo.cy.js‚Äù)
